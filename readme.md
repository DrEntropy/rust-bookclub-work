# Rust Book Club

This readme will capture lessons learned / etc from the Book and the Book club.  Code will be in various folders at this level. 

## Chapter 1
This was just a chapter about setting up and making sure rust runs.  `hello_cargo` is the first (cargo based) program that we make. 

## Chapter 2
This chapter introduces crates, variables, types, loops, matching and Result types in Rust using a simple `guessing_game` program. All of these concepts will be covered in more detail in later chapters. 

## Chapter 3
This chapter has the reader program a guessing game in rust, just to see a whole working program and to get a feel for the language.  It covers `match`, `loop`, `break`, `continue`, `Result` and `expect` as well as using crates like `rand` to generate random numbers.  All of these things will be covered in more detail in later chapters.
